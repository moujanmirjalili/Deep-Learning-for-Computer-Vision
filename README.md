In this course *Deep Learning for Computer Vision*, I worked on a series of practical projects that covered a broad range of computer vision topics. The projects followed the structure of the lectures and included tasks such as building and training neural networks, implementing convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and applying transfer learning for image classification. We explored advanced tasks like image segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation, as well as visualizing internal representations of CNNs and experimenting with perceptual loss functions. Other projects focused on generative models for image synthesis (like GANs and VAEs), vision transformers, and handling more complex data such as videos and point clouds. We also implemented methods related to weak supervision, domain adaptation, and self-supervised learning. Towards the end of the course, we explored cutting-edge vision foundation models, neural rendering techniques, and real-world applications of computer vision in biology and medicine. Overall, these projects provided hands-on experience with both foundational and state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning for computer vision.
